# Analyzing-Rideshare-Trips-in-Chicago

All trips, starting November 2018, were reported by Transportation Network Providers (sometimes called rideshare companies) to the City of Chicago as part of routine reporting required by ordinance.

This project focuses on the recorded rideshare trips in Chicago from November 2018 through March 2019. The dataset has 1 million records, each representing a specific trip.

I chose this dataset for supervised learning because of my work in the automotive sector in Chicago. All my data science work to date has come from the Chicago Data Portal and has encompassed speeding violations, accidents, and now rideshares.

In addition, this dataset has a substantial amount of data (1 million records) and continuous features, which can then be clustered to identify expensive/cheap fares, long distance/nearby rides, or other relationships

I will be clustering this dataset using 4 different methods to determine which has the best score.
